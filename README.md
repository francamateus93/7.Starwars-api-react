# Star Wars API React Project

This project is a web application that interacts with the Star Wars API to provide detailed information about starships, their pilots, and the films in which they appear. It uses React for building the user interface and follows design principles such as SOLID and Clean Code to ensure maintainable and scalable code.

📄 Main Features:

- Explore Starships: Users can browse a list of starships and select one to view specific details, including technical information, associated pilots, and related movies.

- Pilot and Film Details: For each starship, detailed information about its pilots and the movies it appears in is provided, along with relevant images and descriptions.

- Responsive Interface: The application is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

## 💻 Technologies

- React: Main library for building the user interface.
- React Router: For navigation between different views in the application.
- Custom Hooks: Implemented to handle API calls and manage loading and error states, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.
- Tailwind CSS: Used for styling and UI design, enabling fast and efficient customization.
- JavaScript: Core programming language used.
- HTML5 y CSS3: For the basic structure and layout.
